Collection : Root interface with basic methods like add(), remove(), 
             contains(), isEmpty(), addAll(), ... etc.
 
Set : Doesn't allow duplicates and elements are not-order. 
						1.HashSet
						2.TreeSet

List : Can contain duplicates and elements are ordered. 
						1.ArrayList
						2.LinkedList

Map : Contains Key value pairs. Doesn't allow duplicates.  

The difference between Set and Map interface is that in Set we 
have only keys, whereas in Map, we have key, value pairs.
